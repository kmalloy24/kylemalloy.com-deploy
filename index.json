Install nvm if using Windows to roll back Node. npm i firebase@9.0.0 to rollback Firebase.

But then once the project successfully deployed to Firebase hosting the link would just load into an error\u0026hellip;\nI also tried firebase experiments:disable webframeworks and then use svelte-adapter-firebase but ran into more issues.\nFinally I deployed through Vercel via the CLI and it worked perfectly.
