Why use Vercel Analytics? # #1 Privacy # Data privacy has become a mainstream concern. Rather than giving up your user\u0026rsquo;s data to big tech when using a tool like Google Analytics, you can build trust with your users, and only store anonymized data. Vercel Analytics¬†does not use cookies, and is GDPR Compliant, so no need for an annoying cookie disclaimer on your site.\nOther privacy first options include,\nFathom (paid) Umami (open-source, self-hosted) #2 Integrated Infrastructure # Having analytics built into Vercel means that if you are already hosting your project there then you can keep things all on one platform rather than using multiple third-party services. This is especially powerful when taking advantage of other Vercel features like Speed Insights, and overall makes makes for an excellent DX.\n#3 Usability # The analytics dashboard\u0026rsquo;s UI is simple and easy to use - so you can spend less time digging for the data you want to see.\nConfigure Vercel Analytics with Sveltekit in 3 Lines of Code # It\u0026rsquo;s easy to setup Vercel Analytics in your app no matter what framework you\u0026rsquo;re using. But Sveltekit makes it dead simple, and the setup is the same whether you are using JS or TS. For setup in other frameworks, and the most up to date information, refer to the official quickstart in the Vercel Docs.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to quickly go thorough the steps and then a few issues I ran into on my project.\n1. Enable Web Analytics # On the¬†Vercel dashboard, select your Project, then click enable on the¬†Analytics¬†tab.\nEnabling Web Analytics will add new routes (scoped at /_vercel/insights/*) after your next deployment. 2. Add @vercel/analytics to your project # For npm, run \u0026ndash; npm i @vercel/analytics\n3. Call the inject function in src/routes/+layout.svelte # Add the following 3 lines of code into the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag of your root layout.\nimport { dev } from \u0026#39;$app/environment\u0026#39;; import { inject } from \u0026#39;@vercel/analytics\u0026#39;; inject({ mode: dev ? \u0026#39;development\u0026#39; : \u0026#39;production\u0026#39; }); 4. Deploy # Deploy your app using vercel deploy or if your git repo is connected then push the changes to your main branch. Visit your site (See troubleshooting tip #2 below) If everything is set up properly, you should be able to see a Fetch/XHR request in your browser\u0026rsquo;s Network tab from /_vercel/insights/view when you visit any page. Troubleshooting # The docs have the code going into +layout.js/ts; however, it should just go into the \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; tag of +layout.svelte. After the final step you will need to revisit your site to start tracking visitors. If you use an ad blocker make sure that it is disabled or visit the site initially from a different browser, otherwise your ad blocker will block the request.

You also have to run the test manually and document them.\nWhat makes Vercel Speed Insights so handy is that it collects vitals from your actual users and displays the data on a nice dashboard within your project. It also calculates an overall metric called the¬†Real Experience Score, which is the combined score experienced by your¬†visitors.\nIf you are already hosting your project on Vercel it makes it really nice to keep things within the same ecosystem so that you can take advantage of other useful features, like Vercel Analytics, which can be setup with a few lines of code in Sveltekit.\nIf you want to use Speed Insights with a Sveltekit project you will need to use the Speed Insights API as it only supports Next.js, Nuxt.js, and Gatsby with zero configuration.\nThe Vercel docs are a little light on the topic and their Sveltekit example is done with Javascript. It took me a bit to put the pieces together, and adapt the example to my Typescipt project, so hopefully this step-by-step guide will provide some additional value.\nIvo Berger wrote a blog post in 2021 that dives deeper into the API and is an excellent resource as well.\n1. Install Web Vitals # To start, make sure you have installed the Chrome Web Vitals Package in your project. If not, run üëá\nnpm i web-vitals\nThis is a production dependency. 2. Update vite.config.ts # Sveltekit uses Vite as the build tool, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to define the analytics ID for your Vercel project in vite.config.ts. To do this add the highlighted code below.\nNote: The Vercel Analytics ID environment variable is inlined during the build process. It is not part of your project environment variables, and is accessed by process.env inside Node.js.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 import { sveltekit } from \u0026#39;@sveltejs/kit/vite\u0026#39;; import { defineConfig } from \u0026#39;vitest/config\u0026#39;; export default defineConfig({ plugins: [sveltekit()], test: { include: [\u0026#39;src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts}\u0026#39;] }, define: { \u0026#39;import.meta.env.VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID\u0026#39;: JSON.stringify(process.env.VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID) } }); In Vercel\u0026rsquo;s JS Example the vite.config.js looks like this.\nimport { sveltekit } from \u0026#39;@sveltejs/kit/vite\u0026#39;; /** @type {import(\u0026#39;vite\u0026#39;).UserConfig} */ const config = { plugins: [sveltekit()], define: { \u0026#39;import.meta.env.VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID\u0026#39;: JSON.stringify(process.env.VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID) } }; export default config; 3. Create vitals.ts # Next, create a new file in src\u0026gt;lib called vitals.ts.\nLooking at the Javascript example from Vercel, and the Typescript example from Ivo Berger, we see that they are fairly similar. Both will work, but both also throw a few Typescript errors. The errors won\u0026rsquo;t stop the app from building and working correctly \u0026ndash; so for now let\u0026rsquo;s copy Ivo\u0026rsquo;s Typescript code and save the file.\n// vitals.ts import type { Metric } from \u0026#39;web-vitals\u0026#39;; import { getCLS, getFCP, getFID, getLCP, getTTFB } from \u0026#39;web-vitals\u0026#39;; export type AnalyticsOptions = { params: Record\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;; path: string; analyticsId: string; debug?: true; }; const vitalsUrl = \u0026#39;\u0026lt;https://vitals.vercel-analytics.com/v1/vitals\u0026gt;\u0026#39;; function getConnectionSpeed(): string { return \u0026#39;connection\u0026#39; in navigator \u0026amp;\u0026amp; navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#39;effectiveType\u0026#39; in navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;] ? navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;effectiveType\u0026#39;] : \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; } function sendToAnalytics(metric: Metric, options: AnalyticsOptions) { const page = Object.entries(options.params).reduce( (acc, [key, value]) =\u0026gt; acc.replace(value, `[${key}]`), options.path ); const body = { dsn: options.analyticsId, id: metric.id, page, href: location.href, event_name: metric.name, value: metric.value.toString(), speed: getConnectionSpeed() }; if (options.debug) { console.log(\u0026#39;[Analytics]\u0026#39;, metric.name, JSON.stringify(body, null, 2)); } const blob = new Blob([new URLSearchParams(body).toString()], { // This content type is necessary for `sendBeacon`: type: \u0026#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#39; }); if (navigator.sendBeacon) { navigator.sendBeacon(vitalsUrl, blob); } else fetch(vitalsUrl, { body: blob, method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, credentials: \u0026#39;omit\u0026#39;, keepalive: true }); } export function webVitals(options: AnalyticsOptions): void { try { getFID((metric) =\u0026gt; sendToAnalytics(metric, options)); getTTFB((metric) =\u0026gt; sendToAnalytics(metric, options)); getLCP((metric) =\u0026gt; sendToAnalytics(metric, options)); getCLS((metric) =\u0026gt; sendToAnalytics(metric, options)); getFCP((metric) =\u0026gt; sendToAnalytics(metric, options)); } catch (err) { console.error(\u0026#39;[Analytics]\u0026#39;, err); } } 4. Update src/routes/+layout.svelte # The last thing we\u0026rsquo;ll need to do in the codebase is add the following imports into the \u0026lt;scipt\u0026gt; tag of the root layout.\n// Import SvelteKit module import { browser } from \u0026#39;$app/environment\u0026#39;; // Import function from vitals.ts import { webVitals } from \u0026#39;$lib/vitals\u0026#39;; // Retrieve Vercel analytics ID let analyticsId = import.meta.env.VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID; // Sync up browser session \u0026amp; Vercel project $: if (browser \u0026amp;\u0026amp; analyticsId) { webVitals({ path: $page.url.pathname, params: $page.params, analyticsId }); } 5. Deploy \u0026amp; Revist Your URL # After deploying the new code, and visiting your project link on the web (you may need to disable adblocker), you should be good to go! Navigate to the Speed Insights tab on your Vercel project dashboard to start using the tool.\nNote: Personal Accounts can enable Speed Insights on a single project at a time. To enable Speed Insights on multiple projects, transfer to a Team Account.\n6. BONUS: Refactor vitals.ts # Now that we know the code works, lets deal with those pesky Typescript errors to help clean up the code, and enforce type safety.\nWe are getting two TS errors within the getConnectionSpeed function for various reasons.\nLine 2: Type \u0026lsquo;unknown\u0026rsquo; is not assignable to type \u0026lsquo;string\u0026rsquo;. ts(2322)\nLine 4: Type \u0026lsquo;{}\u0026rsquo; may represent a primitive value, which is not permitted as the right operand of the \u0026lsquo;in\u0026rsquo; operator. ts(2638)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 function getConnectionSpeed(): string { return \u0026#39;connection\u0026#39; in navigator \u0026amp;\u0026amp; navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \u0026#39;effectiveType\u0026#39; in navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;] ? navigator[\u0026#39;connection\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;effectiveType\u0026#39;] : \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; } Let\u0026rsquo;s feed the function and errors into ChatGPT and see if it can help us. You can see the chat here which explains what is going on at each step.\nWe end up with the following Typescript interface and function.\ninterface NavigatorWithConnection extends Navigator { connection?: { effectiveType?: string; }; } function getConnectionSpeed(): string { const nav: NavigatorWithConnection = navigator; if (nav.connection \u0026amp;\u0026amp; nav.connection.effectiveType) { return nav.connection.effectiveType; } return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; } That\u0026rsquo;s it! Substituting the code above will result in zero TS errors.\nResources # Speed Insights API Reference How to use Vercel Analytics with SvelteKit Chrome Web Vitals NPM Refactor vitals.ts with ChatGPT ","date":"27 October 2023","permalink":"/blog/vercel-speed-insights/","section":"‚úçÔ∏è Blog","summary":"Intro # Vercel Speed Insights is a great tool that can track performance of your website or application overtime, providing checkpoints for production builds, so you can more easily troubleshoot performance drops between releases.","title":"Configure Vercel Speed Insights API with Sveltekit \u0026 Typescript"},{"content":"","date":"27 October 2023","permalink":"/tags/typescript/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"typescript"},{"content":" Projects # A few of my projects are featured below.

Follow these instructions to install the CLI, adapter, and then svelte.config.js should look like this:\nimport adapter from \u0026#39;@sveltejs/adapter-vercel\u0026#39;; import { vitePreprocess } from \u0026#39;@sveltejs/kit/vite\u0026#39;; /** @type {import(\u0026#39;@sveltejs/kit\u0026#39;).Config} */ const config = { preprocess: vitePreprocess(), kit: { adapter: adapter(), } }; export default config; To deploy updates going forward simply run vercel from the CLI in the root of the project.\nA lot of people seemed to have issues deploying through Firebase Hosting so I suggest digging through the Discord if you run into issues.\nüéâ Go Further # Keep the lesson going!\nUpdate the homepage Copy code from course source code Add gradient headings - see my source code Change Daisy UI theme Update static folder to change favicon, add link icons Finish the edit page, add a Daisy UI header to the layout Finish UX flow of login pages To change the Daisy UI theme update tailwind.config.js then change data-theme in app.html.\n/** @type {import(\u0026#39;tailwindcss\u0026#39;).Config} */ module.exports = { content: [\u0026#39;./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}\u0026#39;], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [require(\u0026#34;daisyui\u0026#34;)], daisyui: { themes: [\u0026#34;light\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;forest\u0026#34;], }, } Image Credit: Fireship\n","date":"6 August 2023","permalink":"/blog/fkit/","section":"‚úçÔ∏è Blog","summary":"I recently completed the Sveltekit Full Course from Fireship.io where you build a Linktree clone using Sveltekit, Firebase, Tailwind, and Daisy UI.\nAs someone new to web development in general, I ran into some problems along the way.","title":"Fireship FKIT Course Notes"},{"content":"","date":"6 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/tailwind/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tailwind"},{"content":" ","date":"2 July 2023","permalink":"/resume/","section":"Experience","summary":" ","title":"Experience"},{"content":"","date":"25 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/autocad/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"autocad"},{"content":"","date":"25 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/civ-eng/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"civ-eng"},{"content":"","date":"25 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/lisp/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"lisp"},{"content":" Prompt # Write code for autocad lisp command for total length\nCode Output # (defun c:totallength (/ ss len) (setq ss (ssget)) (setq len 0.0) (if ss (progn (setq nents (sslength ss)) (repeat nents (setq ent (ssname ss (setq i (1- i)))) (setq len (+ len (vla-get-length (vlax-ename-\u0026gt;vla-object ent)))) ) (princ (strcat \u0026#34;\\nTotal length: \u0026#34; (rtos len))) ) (princ \u0026#34;\\nNo objects selected.\u0026#34;) ) (princ) ) Instructions from ChatGPT # This command defines a new function called totallength and then defines two variables: ss to store the selection set and len to store the total length of the selected objects.\nThe function first uses the ssget function to prompt the user to select objects.
